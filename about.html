    <h1>About This Program</h1>
    <p> This is a template for making your own parametric curve and surface animations.
        You are free to use and modify this in any way you would like.
        If you build an example to share with others, you can use this page to
        write an overview or give instructions.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Modifying The Curve and Surface</h2>
    <p>
        This program is broken into several files, to minimize the amount of things
        you have to deal with when first starting out.
        If you are a beginner to Three JS - you should ignore all files except <strong>calculations.js</strong>.
        This file defines two functions, <strong>parametricCurvePoint</strong> and  <strong>parametricSurfacePoint</strong>
        that you need to implement, and the rest of the files take care of everything else.
    </p>
        


    
    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p> This set of controls right now has three parameters labeled <strong>a,b,c</strong> which
    range from 0 to 1.  You may use these in your formula for the parametric curve or surface
        but to do so you must call them <strong>ui.a, ui.b, ui.c</strong> as all variables
    set through the user interface are named this way.
    

    
    
    
    <h2>Surface</h2>
    <p> The parameters under the surface tab control its <strong>resolution, opacity, reflectivity</strong>
        and <strong>color</strong>.
    </p>



    <h2>Surface</h2>
    <p> The parameters under the curve tab control its <strong>resolution, width</strong>
        and <strong>color</strong>.
